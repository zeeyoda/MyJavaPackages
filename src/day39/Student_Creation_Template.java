// any time you create a class, it will become a blueprint for object
// this class type can be a type for variable
// for example String has its own class so we can create String variable
//and assign a String object

//in here student becomes a blue print for creating student object
//and any student object has 3 attributes defined by instance field/variable
public class Student_Creation_Template {

   //instance field/variable:
    String name ;
    int age;
    char gender ;
